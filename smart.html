      <h3>Its Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Effective scheduling is the backbone of productivity. Most people either over-schedule or forget important tasks. 
        Smart Scheduling solves this by using intelligent logic to balance workload, break time, and energy, avoiding burnout and missed goals.
