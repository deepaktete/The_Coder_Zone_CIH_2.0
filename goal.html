      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>
        The Goal & Habits module helps users define clear objectives and track the small daily actions required to achieve them.
        This system focuses on consistency by turning big goals into manageable habits that build progress over time.

      <h3>Its Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Setting goals is easy, but maintaining habits is where true growth happens.
        Tracking habits not only improves discipline and focus, but also creates a measurable path toward self-improvement.
        Over time, this reduces mental fatigue, improves decision-making, and increases motivation.

      <h3>How It's Useful for a Routine Assistant</h3>
      <p>
        In AURA, Goal & Habit tracking is the foundation of personalized scheduling.
        By analyzing your habits, the assistant learns your behavior patterns, optimal work times, and consistency levels.
        This allows AURA to auto-suggest the best times for key tasks, set habit reminders, and even notify you when youâ€™re falling off trackâ€”helping you stay aligned with long-term goals.
